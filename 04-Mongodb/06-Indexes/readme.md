##  What is an Index?

An index in MongoDB is a special data structure (usually a B-tree) that stores a small portion of the collection’s data in an easy-to-search form.

It helps MongoDB find documents faster, just like the index at the back of a book helps you find topics quickly.

Without an index, MongoDB performs a collection scan, checking every document — which is slow for large collections.


### Why Use Indexes?
* ✅ Improves query performance
* ✅ Supports efficient sorting
* ✅ Helps enforce uniqueness
* ✅ Reduces CPU and memory load
