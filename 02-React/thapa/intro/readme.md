## What is React.js?
React.js (commonly called React) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained as an open-source project. React focuses on creating fast, interactive, and reusable UI components.

### Why Use React.js?
* Reusable Components: Save time by reusing code across the app.
* Fast & Efficient: Virtual DOM reduces unnecessary updates.
* Strong Community & Ecosystem: Many libraries, tools, and resources available.
* SEO-Friendly: With tools like Next.js, React can be used for server-side rendering, improving SEO.

### React History
| Year          | Event                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2011**      | React was created internally at Facebook by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer.                      |
| **2013**      | React was open-sourced at **JSConf US**.                                                                |
| **2015**      | **React Native** was introduced (for mobile apps).                                                      |
| **2016**      | React fiber (complete rewrite) was announced.                                                           |
| **2017**      | React Fiber became the core algorithm.                                                                  |
| **2020**      | React introduced **Concurrent Mode (experimental)** and **React Server Components**.                    |
| **2022**      | **React 18** was released with features like automatic batching, transitions, and concurrent rendering. |
| **2024–2025** | Focus on **React Server Components**, **bundler support**, and **better developer experience**.         |



#### Component-Based Architecture
* Applications are built using components, which are reusable and modular pieces of code.
* Example: A Button component can be reused throughout the app.

#### Virtual DOM
* React uses a Virtual DOM to improve performance.
* When a component’s state changes, React updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM instead of reloading the entire page.

#### JSX (JavaScript XML)
* React uses JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.

#### One-way Data Binding
* Data flows from parent to child components (unidirectional).
* This makes apps more predictable and easier to debug.

#### State & Props
* State: Represents dynamic data within a component.
* Props: Short for properties, used to pass data from parent to child components.
